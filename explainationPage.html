                    In order to win a minesweeper game you must "find" the mines in the table.
                    <br>
                    At each stage, there are different numbers of mines that will be displayed
                    <br>
                    on the game page, to know where the mines are: first, click on one of the cells
                    <br>
                    in the game table.
                    When you find a mine location, right-click the cell and you will immediately
                    <br>
                    see a warning sign in the cell to remind the player the places of the mines that he thinks.
                    <br>
                    Once you've checked all the mined cells you'll know if you were right ...
                    <br>
                    Be careful not to press a mine cell in case of a cell where a mine is forced to
                    <br>
                    start from the beginning.
                    <br>
                    Only after you have succeeded in the current level you can move on to the next level.
                    <br>
                    Hope you enjoy it, good luck!
